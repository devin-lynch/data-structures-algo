Each language has its own data types and data structures to organize the data types.

Operations on data structures:
    Insertion:
        add a new data item in a given collection of items
    Deletion:
        delete data from a list
    Traversal:
        access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed
    Searching:
        find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection
    Sorting:
        having data that is sorted
    Access:
        how do we access this data that we have on our computer


Arrays (sometimes called 'lists')
    organize items sequentially (one after another in memory)
    often the simplist and widely used data structure
    least amount of rules and smallest footprint

    lookup O(1)
    push   O(1)
    insert O(n)
    delete O(n)
