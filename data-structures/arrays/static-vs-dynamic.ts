// Static arrays are fixed in size, meaning you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold.
// Dynamic arrays allow us to copy and rebuild an array at a new location, which with more memory if we wanted more memory. Don't need to determine the size ahead of time. 

// C++
// int a[20];
// int b[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
